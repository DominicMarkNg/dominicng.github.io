  "description": "Radial Basis Function (RBF) Networks serve as a potent tool for addressing problems associated with nonlinear mappings between input and output spaces. They find their footing in the realm of artificial neural networks, where their operational mechanism is distinct. Unlike traditional neural networks that compute activations via inner products, RBF networks gauge activations based on the distance of the input from fixed points in the input space. This fundamental difference lends RBF networks a unique flavor in tackling nonlinear approximation tasks.",
