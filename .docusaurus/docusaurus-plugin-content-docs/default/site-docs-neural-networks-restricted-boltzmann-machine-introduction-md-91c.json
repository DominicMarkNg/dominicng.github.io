  "description": "Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are a class of generative neural networks with a two-layered bipartite graph structure, comprising visible and hidden units. They are at the crossroads of feature learning, dimensionality reduction, and probabilistic modeling, making them a crucial player in the landscape of unsupervised learning.",
