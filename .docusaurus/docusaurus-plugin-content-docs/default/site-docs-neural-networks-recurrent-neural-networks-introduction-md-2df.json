  "description": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) embody a vibrant segment of neural networks specialized in handling sequential data. Unlike conventional feedforward networks, RNNs possess a memory-like mechanism allowing them to maintain a form of state information across sequences. This unique characteristic makes them a natural choice for tasks involving time-series data, text, and other sequential or temporal data.",
