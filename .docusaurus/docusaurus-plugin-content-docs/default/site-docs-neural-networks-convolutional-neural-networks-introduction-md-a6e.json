  "description": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models particularly adept at processing grid-like data, such as images. Their biological inspiration stems from the visual cortex's mechanism of identifying different patterns and structures in the visual field. This design facilitates the learning of hierarchical features from the data, making CNNs a cornerstone in various computer vision applications.",
