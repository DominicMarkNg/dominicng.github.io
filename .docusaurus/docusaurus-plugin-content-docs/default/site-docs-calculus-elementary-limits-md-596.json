  "description": "In the study of calculus, understanding the concept of a limit is a stepping stone towards delving into continuous functions, derivatives, and integrals. The formal definition, often referred to as the $\\epsilon$-$\\delta$ definition, is important yet can initially seem impenetrable. These are my notes on the formal definition of limit aimed towards building an intuitive understanding.",
