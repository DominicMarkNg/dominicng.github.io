# Introduction to Set Theory Notation

In set theory, specific symbols represent distinct sets of numbers. These include:

- $\mathbb{N}$ for natural numbers: $\{1,2,3,\dots\}$
- $\mathbb{Z}$ for integers: $\{\dots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\dots\}$
- $\mathbb{Q}$ for rational numbers and $\mathbb{R}$ for real numbers.
- Complex numbers are represented by $\mathbb{C}$ and are of the form $a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the square root of -1.

Intervals on the real line can be:
- Open (excluding endpoints) like $(-1,3)$
- Closed (including endpoints) like $[2,3]$
- A combination, such as $[1,2)$.

Sets can also be defined by stating the properties of their elements. For instance:
- $A=\{x|x \text{ satisfies a property}\}$
- $A=\{x:x \text{ satisfies a property}\}$, 
where "|" and ":" mean "such that."

For example, the set of rational numbers is $\mathbb{Q}=\left\{\frac{a}{b}\middle|a,b\in\mathbb{Z},b\neq0\right\}$.

Concepts to understand:
- The idea of subsets ( $A \subset B$ ) and supersets ( $B \supset A$ )
- Every natural number is an integer, so $\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z}$
- Sets are equal if they possess the same elements, e.g., $\{1,2,3\}=\{3,2,1\}$

Special Sets:
- The empty set, represented by $\emptyset$, has no elements.
- Every set is a subset of the universal set, often denoted as $S$. Depending on context, for dice rolls, it's $S=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ and for coin tosses, it's $S=\{H,T\}$.

## Set Operations

In mathematics, set operations are essential tools for manipulating sets and understanding their relationships. Let's explore some fundamental set operations:

### Union

The union of two sets, denoted as $A \cup B$, is a set that contains all elements that belong to either set $A$ or set $B$ or both. Mathematically:

$$
A \cup B = \{x \,|\, x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}
$$

For example, if we have two sets $\{1,2\}$ and $\{2,3\}$, their union is $\{1,2,3\}$ . We can express this operation as $x \in (A \cup B)$ if and only if $(x \in A)$ or $(x \in B)$.

### Intersection

The intersection of two sets, denoted as $A \cap B$, consists of all elements that are present in both set $A$ and set $B$. Mathematically:

$$
A \cap B = \{x \,|\, x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\}
$$

For instance, the intersection of $\{1,2\}$ and $\{2,3\}$ results in $\{2\}$. We can visualize the intersection using a Venn diagram.

### Generalized Union and Intersection

We can extend these operations to three or more sets. If we have sets $A_1, A_2, A_3, \ldots, A_n$, their union $A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \ldots \cup A_n$ contains all elements present in at least one of the sets. This can be written more concisely as:

$$\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i$$

Similarly, the intersection $\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} A_i$ contains elements that are common to all $A_i$'s.

### Complement

The complement of a set $A$, denoted as $A^c$ or $\overline{A}$, consists of all elements that belong to the universal set $S$ but are not in $A$. In other words, it's everything outside of $A$.

### Difference

The difference between two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted as $A - B$, contains elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$. This can also be expressed as $A - B = A \cap B^c$.

### Mutual Exclusivity

Two sets $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive or disjoint if they have no shared elements, which means their intersection is the empty set, $A \cap B = \emptyset$. More generally, several sets are called disjoint if no two of them share a common element.

These fundamental set operations are crucial for various mathematical and logical operations, enabling us to manipulate sets to analyze and solve complex problems.

# De Morgan's Laws in Set Theory

De Morgan's laws are fundamental principles in set theory and logic that describe how to negate complex statements involving unions and intersections of sets. These laws are named after the British mathematician and logician Augustus De Morgan and provide a way to express the complement (negation) of set operations.

## First De Morgan's Law

The first De Morgan's law relates to the complement of a union of sets. It states that the complement of the union of two sets is equal to the intersection of their complements. Mathematically, for sets A and B:

$$(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$$

In words, the complement of the union of two sets is the same as the intersection of their complements.

## Second De Morgan's Law

The second De Morgan's law pertains to the complement of an intersection of sets. It states that the complement of the intersection of two sets is equal to the union of their complements. For sets A and B:

$$(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$$

In simple terms, the complement of the intersection of two sets is equivalent to the union of the complements of those sets.

## Practical Applications

De Morgan's laws are particularly useful when dealing with logic, probability, and set operations in mathematics. They allow us to simplify complex expressions and make them more manageable. These laws also find applications in computer science and digital circuit design, where they help optimize logical operations.

## Example

Let's illustrate De Morgan's laws with an example:

Suppose we have two sets:
- A = {1, 2, 3}
- B = {2, 3, 4}

We want to find the complement of the union of these sets, $(A \cup B)^c$.

1. First, find $A \cup B$:
   $(A \cup B) = \{1, 2, 3\} \cup \{2, 3, 4\} = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$

2. Now, take the complement of $A \cup B$:
   $(A \cup B)^c$ contains all elements not in $A \cup B$, so
   $(A \cup B)^c = \{x \,|\, x \notin \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\} = \{x \,|\, x \notin A \text{ and } x \notin B\} = A^c \cap B^c.$

By applying the first De Morgan's law, we've shown that $(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$, which confirms the validity of De Morgan's laws.

# Distributive Law

The Distributive Law is a fundamental principle in mathematics, particularly in algebra. It describes how multiplication distributes over addition or subtraction. There are two forms of the Distributive Law:

## Left Distributive Law

The left distributive law states that for any real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$:

$$
a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c)
$$

In other words, you can distribute the multiplication $a$ across the addition $b + c$, resulting in the sum of $a \cdot b$ and $a \cdot c$.

## Right Distributive Law

The right distributive law is similar but works in the opposite direction. It states that for any real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$:

$$
(b + c) \cdot a = (b \cdot a) + (c \cdot a)
$$

Here, you can distribute the multiplication $a$ across the addition $b + c$, resulting in the sum of $b \cdot a$ and $c \cdot a$.

## Application

The Distributive Law is a crucial concept in algebra and is used extensively in simplifying expressions and solving equations. It allows us to break down complex expressions into simpler ones, making mathematical calculations more manageable.

### Example

Let's illustrate the Distributive Law with an example:

Suppose we have the expression $3 \cdot (2 + 4)$. We can apply the left distributive law to simplify it as follows:

$$
3 \cdot (2 + 4) = (3 \cdot 2) + (3 \cdot 4) = 6 + 12 = 18
$$

The Distributive Law enables us to distribute the multiplication across the addition, making the calculation straightforward.

In summary, the Distributive Law plays a fundamental role in mathematics, aiding in the simplification of expressions and solving equations involving multiplication and addition (or subtraction).
