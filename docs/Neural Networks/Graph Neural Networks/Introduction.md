Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) mark a significant stride in the domain of machine learning on graphs, allowing models to harness the structural information embedded in data. Unlike traditional neural networks, GNNs thrive in irregular data domains, making them particularly suited for tasks involving networks, social media data, molecular structures, and myriad other graph-structured datasets.

Initially, attempts to learn from graph data often revolved around crafting node embeddings using conventional architectures. A notable approach involved leveraging the adjacency matrix representation of a graph coupled with feature engineering to derive node embeddings. However, these methods were somewhat rigid and failed to capture the rich relational information present in the graph.

The GNN framework emerged as a remedy to these limitations, offering a more flexible and expressive means to learn from graph data. At the core of a GNN is the neighborhood function, which aggregates information from a node's local neighborhood to compute a representation for the node. Alongside, the graph convolution function, which operates in a manner analogous to convolutions in image processing, facilitates the propagation of information through the graph. 

$$
h_v^{(l)} = \sigma \left( W^{(l)} \cdot \text{AGGREGATE}^{(l)} \left( \{ h_u^{(l-1)}, \forall u \in \text{Neighbors}(v) \} \right) + B^{(l)} \cdot h_v^{(l-1)} \right)
$$

Here, $h_v^{(l)}$ denotes the hidden representation of node $v$ at layer $l$, $W^{(l)}$ and $B^{(l)}$ are learnable weight matrices, and $\sigma$ is an activation function.

A myriad of variants and extensions to the basic GNN framework have been proposed to handle different types of graph data and various learning tasks. For instance, GraphSAGE allows for inductive learning on large graphs, Gated Graph Neural Networks introduce gating mechanisms to control the flow of information, and approaches have been devised to handle edge weights, new vertices, relational networks, and directed graphs among others.

Training GNNs involves backpropagation similar to traditional neural networks, albeit with some modifications to accommodate the graph structure. The learning can be performed at the node level or extended to learn graph-level representations, which opens up avenues for a variety of tasks beyond node classification.

Applications of GNNs are as diverse as the data they can process. They have shown remarkable performance in social network analysis, bioinformatics for drug discovery, recommendation systems, and many more areas where data is inherently graph-structured.

In a comparative light, the operation of GNNs can be juxtaposed with Image Convolutional Networks (ICNs), where the regular grid structure in images corresponds to the irregular graph structure in GNNs. However, the convolution operations in GNNs are adapted to cater to the graph domain, showcasing the flexibility and power of neural networks in learning from a wide spectrum of data structures.

In summary, Graph Neural Networks represent a crucial advancement in learning from graph-structured data, extending the boundaries of what is learnable and opening up a plethora of applications that were previously challenging to tackle with traditional machine learning models.
