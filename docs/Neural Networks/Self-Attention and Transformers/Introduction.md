The essence of attention mechanisms lies in their ability to focus on different parts of the input selectively, akin to how human attention zooms in on pertinent details while glossing over the irrelevant. This section elucidates the diverse applications and formulations of attention mechanisms across various domains.

Recurrent models of visual attention iteratively select a sequence of regions or locations in an image to process, as opposed to processing the entire image at once. This mechanism significantly reduces the computational load and enables the model to focus on critical regions.

In the realm of image captioning, attention mechanisms help in aligning parts of an image to words in the generated description. The soft image attention with Spatial Transformer further refines this process, allowing the model to learn where to attend in the image.

Transcending to machine translation, attention helps in aligning words in the source and target languages, especially in sequences of differing lengths. This alignment is crucial for accurately translating phrases and maintaining the context.

Transformer networks epitomize the power of attention mechanisms. They leverage self-attention to process input sequences in parallel, drastically reducing the computational burden associated with sequential processing in RNNs. Key components of the transformer architecture include the Self-Attention module, which calculates attention scores for each pair of positions in the input sequence, and Multihead Attention, which runs multiple self-attention processes in parallel. The incorporation of positional information and the sequence-to-sequence framework further augment the transformer's efficacy in handling sequential data.

Pre-trained transformer-based models like GPT-n, BERT, and T5 have revolutionized the NLP landscape by achieving state-of-the-art performance across a myriad of tasks. They harness the transformer's self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies in text, paving the way for more sophisticated language understanding.

Extending the transformer architecture to vision, the Vision Transformer (ViT) partitions an image into fixed-size patches, linearly embeds them, and processes them with transformer layers. This approach has shown competitive performance compared to traditional CNNs on several vision benchmarks.

Attention mechanisms have also found utility in graph-structured data, where they help in weighting the contributions of different nodes in a graph, facilitating more informed aggregations and predictions.

**Put in picture encapsulating the attention scores, portraying how different parts of the input are weighted and focused upon in diverse applications like machine translation, image captioning, and graph processing, would be instrumental in understanding the functioning and impact of attention mechanisms.**
