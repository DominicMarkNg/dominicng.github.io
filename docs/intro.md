Welcome to this compiliation of my notes on neurology and medicine. I also have a strong interest in mathematics and data science and will regularly update this series of mini-books on these areas.

This series is not a finalized collection but an ongoing project and I'm still in the process of transcribing it all into HTML. My aim at some point will be to add diagrams but currently still learning how to do this.

Hope someone finds this useful!

When code is written this will be in Python (Pytorch) or Julia.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="py" label="Python">

```py
def hello_world():
  print("Hello, world!")
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="julia" label="Julia">

```julia
// highlight-start
function helloWorld()
    println("Hello, world!")
end
// highlight-end
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
